# Burger

"Order A Burger" is a restaurant App that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)operations. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the App will display the burger on the left side of the page under "Available Burgers". When the user selects a burger to eat and clicks the button "Devour Now!" the burger is placed in the right hand column under "Devoured Burgers".

# Built with the following:

Node express using mysql as a database and handlebars to serve html page. This is a single page App.

# Deployed to Heroku:
